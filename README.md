# [JSL04] Submission: Monster Ternary Operator

Practice challenges on Scrimba: https://scrimba.com/playlist/p9bvd5QH3

**Challenge Brief:** In this coding exercise, I worked with the Monster Ternary Operator. I used ternary operators to make decisions based on various scenarios involving Monster Energy drinks.

In each of these challenges, the ternary operator is used to decide between two or more options based on a condition, demonstrating its utility for concise conditional logic. While ternaries make the code more succinct, they are used judiciously to maintain readability, especially for more complex conditions.

## Learning Reflections:

1. I was able to understand what ternaries are and how they are beneficial by using less lines leading to a cleaner code.
2. I still prefer `if-else` statements over ternaries as they are more readable especially for more complex conditions.
3. Challenge 5 was a bit confusing for me, I felt like the instruction wasn't clear in terms of the hours provided (unlike in challenge 4 where it's clearly stated that it should be "below or equal to").
4. Overall, this challenge did provide a detialed understanding of operators, and control flow.
